title: iOS and Horses
---

  My goal in these pages is to share some knowledge with the world and my future self. I started AlelinApps during the pandemic, and released my first app, HotHorse, built with SwiftUI. It was a learning experience, and the easy part was the coding. But, I got through review, eventually, and went live on the App Store. Fast forward 2 years, and I started a full time position as a developer. Even in my short time of coding, I have seen a great deal of change. Most for the better, so I decided to add something to it. I hope you find it helpful. I hope I will.
